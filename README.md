TO DO 
- Check Database before making network calls
- Add paging to pull all top stories for a day as you reach the bottom of the recycler view
- Add bottom navigation to have tabs for top, jobs, asks, shows, and history
  - This should be pretty easy all the calls / display logic between pages would be almost identical 
- Add empty states for no comments, no history, etc
