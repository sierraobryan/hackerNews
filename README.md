TO DO 
- Check Database before making network calls
- Add paging to pull all top stories for a day as you reach the bottom of the recycler view
- Add bottom navigation to have tabs for top, jobs, asks, shows, and history
  - This should be pretty easy all the calls / display logic between pages would be almost identical 
- Add empty states for no comments, no history, etc
- Add loading screens (some of these calls take a lonnnnng time) 
- Dynamic ToolBar (matter more if there was a bottom nav)
- Webviews because all the text is html ): 
- you can have comments on comments 
- Add a refresh button 
- Add user profile information
